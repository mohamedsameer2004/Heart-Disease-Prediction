# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict heart disease using various machine learning models. The dataset used contains several features related to patient health, and the target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project uses various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- **age**: Age of the patient
- **sex**: Gender of the patient
- **cp**: Chest pain type (4 values)
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang**: Exercise induced angina
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- **ca**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- **thal**: Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
- **target**: 1 indicates presence of heart disease, 0 indicates absence.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA section explores the relationships between the features and the target variable, providing insights into which factors contribute most to the presence of heart disease.

- **Correlation Analysis**: Identified correlations between different features.
- **Feature Analysis**: Detailed exploration of key features like `sex`, `cp`, `fbs`, `restecg`, `exang`, `slope`, `ca`, and `thal`.

## Modeling
Various machine learning models were trained and evaluated to predict heart disease:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Results
The Random Forest model performed the best, with higher accuracy compared to other models. Detailed performance metrics for each model are included in the notebook.

## Conclusion
The Random Forest model is recommended for predicting heart disease based on the provided dataset. Future work could include hyperparameter tuning and exploration of additional features to further improve accuracy.
